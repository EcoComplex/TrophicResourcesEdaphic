  "abstract": {Ecosystem sustainable use requires reliable information about its
 biotic and abiotic structure and functioning. Accurate knowledge of
 trophic relations is central for the understanding of ecosystem
 dynamics, which in turn, is essential for food web stability analyzes
 and the development of sustainable practices. There is a rapid growth
 in the knowledge on how belowground biodiversity regulates the
 structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although, the
 available information about trophic relationships is hard to find and
 fragmented. This gathering the information available worldwide about
 the food resources of soil mesofauna. From the 3105 hits of the
 initial search on food resources of soil microarthropods, only a total
 of 195 published works related particular species, genera, and
 families to particular trophic resources, the majority of them dealing
 with soils of the Palearctic region. From the 195 publications we
 extracted 3009 records relating specific taxonomic groups to their
 trophic resources, 20% mention saprophytic fungi as a food resource,
 16% cite microfauna, 11% mention bacteria, 10% litter and 5% cite
 Mycorrhizal fungi. The available information was highly skewed, the
 73.71% comes from Acari, and within these, 50.62% correspond just to
 Sarcoptiformes. For Collembola, the literature is scarce, the majority
 coming from Arthropleona. This review highlights the general lack of
 information relating species, genera, and families of the soil
 mesofauna to specific trophic resources. It also highlights that
 available research mostly comes from European sites, with the use of
 trophic resources by the mesofauna of the majority of the soils in
 other parts of the world still largely unknown.
